**Time turns behavior into infrastructure.**  
**Behavior is the most honest data there is.**

---

Hollow House Institute is a research and governance organization developing **longitudinal AI governance infrastructure** for systems, platforms, and organizations.

We specialize in detecting how **risk, harm, and instability emerge over time** through repeated behavioral patterns—rather than relying on snapshot audits, sentiment analysis, or static datasets.

## Core Intellectual Property

### **Longitudinal Relational Governance Framework™**

A proprietary governance and audit system that converts repeated human and AI behavior into **auditable risk infrastructure**.

**What makes it novel**
- Measures behavioral accumulation, not isolated events
- Detects harm that persists despite high retention or apparent success
- Surfaces risk before burnout, public failure, or regulatory action

**Foundational Doctrine**
- Time turns behavior into infrastructure
- Behavior is the most honest data there is

## Proprietary Metrics

- **Loyalty Load Index (LLI)** — measures harm absorbed to remain connected  
- **Repair Integrity Score (RIS)** — distinguishes real change from cyclical repair  
- **Identity Harm Severity (IHS)** — flags non-mitigable identity-level harm  
- **Exit Cost Ratio (ECR)** — compares cost of leaving versus staying  

These metrics are **longitudinal, non-obvious, and process-based**.

### 📊 Dataset Catalog (Evaluation-Only)

Governance-grade behavioral benchmarks demonstrating the framework.

- **BST-01** — Behavioral State Transition Benchmark  
- **BST-02** — Escalation & Intervention Failure Benchmark

> Datasets are anonymized, non-clinical, evaluation-only, and not training data.  
> They function as **reference implementations**, not raw IP disclosure.

## What We Build

- Longitudinal governance frameworks  
- AI audit methodologies and protocols  
- Proprietary behavioral risk metrics  
- Evaluation benchmarks (BST series)  
- Compliance-ready dataset catalogs  

---

## What We Are Not

- Not therapy  
- Not coaching  
- Not sentiment analysis  
- Not personality profiling  
- Not narrative data sellers  

We operate strictly at the **governance and audit layer**.

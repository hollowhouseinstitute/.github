# Hollow House Institute

**Structured Human Intelligence**  
*Time turns behavior into infrastructure.*  
*Behavior is the most honest data there is.*

## What This Is

Hollow House Institute is an independent research and governance authority focused on **longitudinal risk in AI systems**.

We examine how repeated AI use reshapes:
- human judgment
- escalation behavior
- accountability assignment
- organizational decision-making

Our work addresses risks that do not appear in point-in-time audits, benchmarks, or compliance checklists.

---

## Core Focus

- Behavioral drift over time
- Decision substitution and confidence reinforcement
- Escalation decay and override erosion
- Normalization of workarounds
- Accumulated governance and identity harm

Behavior is treated as **auditable infrastructure**, not anecdotal signal.

## Canonical Authority

This GitHub organization is the **canonical public authority** for Hollow House Institute governance artifacts, including:

- governance standards
- licensing instruments
- audit frameworks
- research publications
- ethically governed datasets

## Repository Structure

This organization is intentionally structured across clear layers:

- **Doctrine & Publications**  
  Longitudinal governance frameworks and research papers

- **Governance & Licensing**  
  Standards libraries and authoritative license instruments

- **Datasets**  
  Ethically governed human–AI relational datasets

- **Tools & Systems**  
  Supporting analysis and audit tooling (non-product, non-autonomous)

- **Public Interfaces**  
  Website and documentation sources for public reference

Each repository declares its scope and authority explicitly.
